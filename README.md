## Project Overview
- This code only shows what I initially started. The code used on the above website is quite different from the initial code.
- Initially started the portfolio project with the given design layouts provided from the designer.
- This was the very first project to work on in collaboration with a designer which taught me alot.
- I tried to implement the design by using CSS grid, but later found out it was better to use flex-box.
- Eventually, the portfolio was brought to an end by the designer.

## Built With
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Front End library
